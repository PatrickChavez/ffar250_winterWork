      <p>(… Awfully nonchalant.) I am a fallen angel you see. I went against my duties of overseeing death in order to eliminate the evil spirits that plague the world.</p>

      <p>After many years of watching and recording the deaths of countless humans, I became jaded over time. I believe that evil spirits were the reason for mankind’s misfortune and resolved to eliminate as much as I could.</p>

      <p>They come with different names: sometimes they are called demons, while other times they are curses. They are the manifestation of a family’s misfortune. They vary in size and number, but each family has at least one demon that looms over them. They attach themselves to the parents first. After the parents pass away, the demons then go for the offspring.</p>

      <p>... They can be difficult to perceive, but some people who have contact with the supernatural are able to see them more clearly, correct?</p>

      <p>That is correct, you are well informed.</p>

      <p>Books, eh? Do you perhaps know a nearby library? I’ve always been fascinated by human literature. This is a bit embarrassing to admit, but I have a soft spot for fantasy novels.</p>

      <p>I know of one! The nearby town has an impressive collection. I just finished reading one, so you can borrow it if you like.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">Thus, we ended up having a family dinner over some carrot soup and lemon cake.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">As thanks, Samael decided to help our family with food are other outdoor activities. Apparently, we were the first humans that he interacted with at length. I guess he was too focused on demon-hunting and didn’t want others to get involved.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">Samael, an angel with a noble cause exiled from Heaven for going against his orders… he really is like someone from a fantasy story.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">The coziness of that fateful day leaves a warm feeling in my heart.</p>
