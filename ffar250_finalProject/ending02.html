        <p>How ironic, seeing so much death led me to try destroying as many demons as possible, yet I couldn’t even protect the ones who considered me a part of their family. I am ashamed. </p>

        <p>You are correct, but now I feel conflicted. I don’t know how to go about my mission anymore. I want to defeat as many demons as possible, but I don’t want to be completely divorced from home.</p>

        <p>Why not a bit of both? Do what you’ve always done and hunt evil spirits around this area and whenever I have time, I’ll tag along with you if you need to explore further.</p>

      <p class="narrationBlack">This home feels a lot different now. Before, it was a place of warm and fuzzy memories, but now, I’m not sure how to describe it. Things are definitely tougher without Mom and Dad, but I know that they're watching over me. And, as long as Sam stays by my side, I know that I can pull through. I will forever be grateful to have a place that I can return to.</p>
