    <p class="narrationBlack">My name is Cosette Gauthier, I’m 19 years old.</p>

    <p class="narrationBlack">I come from a poor family. Apparently, my parents used to be quite rich, but after a sudden series of unfortunate events, they lost most of their wealth and were relegated to living in a forest. I was born soon after.
    </p>

    <p class="narrationBlack">Despite all this, Mom and Dad worked tirelessly to make sure food was on the table and that I received an education. We didn’t have much, but we were happy.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">But good things can’t last forever, can they?</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">Sam left shortly after the picture was taken. Cleansing evil spirits and helping people suffering from curses is basically his life’s mission, so he couldn't stay in one place for too long. He said that he’d be back
      someday, but...</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">Mom and Dad… passed away recently.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">It happened so quickly, one day they were fine, the next day they both fell gravely ill. A week later, they succumbed to their illness.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">I always thought that with enough hard work, I could graduate from a top university, get a good job and then we could all live in a better home. Now, everything feels pointless.</p>

    <img class="storyPicture" src="assets/images/Intro/HomeBlue.png" alt="Intro">

    <p class="narrationWhite">It’s so quiet in the house now, the atmosphere’s so lonely. I miss smelling Mom’s cooking. I miss hearing Dad chopping firewood outside. I miss reading books next to the fireplace with Sam.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">Lately, I’ve begun doing research on angels and have been trying to figure out a way to contact them. Luckily, the town library has a ton of books on the matter.</p>

      <p class="narrationWhite">I know it's selfish to contact him while he’s busy, but everything’s been so unbearable, just I want to talk to someone. I want to see Sam again. </p>

      <img src="assets/images/Cosette/CosetteTiredSmile.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Let’s see… Ah! Here it is: in order to call upon the angel Samael, input this combination of numbers into any kind of phone. The phone doesn’t have to be functional for this to work. Excellent! The antique phone I’ve collected has come in handy!</p>
