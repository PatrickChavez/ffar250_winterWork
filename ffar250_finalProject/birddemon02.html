    <p class="narrationWhite">It happened about a year ago, I was on summer break from college and was busy helping my parents out whenever I could.</p>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Cosette/CosetteFrown.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>A noble knight, betrayed by those he loved most. What a sad story…</p>
    </div>

    <p class="narrationWhite">My parents were out for groceries and I'd already prepared the kitchenware and cleaned the house, so I used my free time to read a book. Still, Mom and Dad are a little late, I hope nothing bad happened to them.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">*SLAM*</p>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Dad/DadFrown.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Cosette, quick, prepare a bed!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Cosette/CosetteSurprise.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>R-right!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="narrationWhite">A peculiar scene was shown before of me: resting on the shoulders of my parents was an unconscious horned man in a military uniform. Looking closely, I realized that he had a crescent-shaped halo above his head and a pointy tail on his back.</p>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Mom/MomFrown.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Alright, he’s settled on the bed, I’m going to start applying some first aid. Cossette, could you please prepare carrot soup with the ingredients we bought? I’m going to need your father in case this man’s condition worsens.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Cosette/CosetteAngry.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>I’m on it!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="narrationWhite">It was a tense and awkward moment, but I managed to prepare dinner. Around the time I set up the table, the man woke up.</p>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Samael/SamaelFrown2.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Nnnmm, where am I?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Mom/MomFrown.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Oh, you shouldn't move so suddenly!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Samael/SamaelNeutral.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>It’s fine, my body can heal rather quickly. You have my thanks for your hospitality, but I must take my leave. I do not wish to burden you all any further.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Dad/DadSmile.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Nonsense lad! There’s no need to rush, you can stay here as long as you need for your injuries to recover. So come and join us for our family dinner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Samael/SamaelSweatFrown2.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Are you all really comfortable inviting a stranger to eat with you? For all you know I could be a fiend that could gut you all in a blink of an eye. My appearance should warn you as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Mom/MomSmile.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Nonsense! You don’t seem like the type to do that. You have a certain innocent look in your eyes. Besides, we’re all outcasts here, so we should help each other out. In fact, it would please us greatly if you could come eat with us, isn’t that right, Cosette?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Cosette/CosetteSweatFrown2.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>Huh!? Y-yes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Samael/SamaelSweatFrown2.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>She doesn’t seem very enthusiastic…</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox">
      <img src="assets/images/Mom/MomSmile.jpg" alt="mugshot">
      <p>She’s just shy around strangers, it’s normal to feel that way. Now come on, everyone, let’s eat!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="narrationWhite">And just like that, we all gathered around the table and started eating.</p>
