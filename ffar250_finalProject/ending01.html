    <p class="narrationWhite">I managed to defeat the demons plaguing my parents’ fortune. I suppose I should be happy, but I feel completely hollow. Mom and Dad are gone. The ones who could’ve benefitted the most from this event can’t reap the benefits of it. I’m safe from an accursed fate, but what I had to go through had already taken its toll.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">…I just want to see a loved one…</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">I typed the number and held my breath…</p>

    </div>

    <p class="narrationWhite">I broke into tears then and there. It was just too much for me.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">It took a couple of days, but Sam finally arrived home. I told him everything that happened. He hugged me and reassured me that everything was going to be alright.</p>

    <p class="narrationWhite">A couple weeks passed soon after…</p>
