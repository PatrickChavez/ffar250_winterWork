    <p class="narrationBlack">It had been three months since Sam had been living with us. He’s been a real big help gathering firewood and forest fruits. Although he always sleeps outside, despite my parents’ insistence on letting him sleep with us. When asked why, he would say that the house was cramped enough as it is and that he prefers not to bother us any further.</p>

    <p class="narrationBlack">Mom and Dad were pretty insistent on letting him stay here, so we should at least respect his boundaries. However, being the hypocrite that I am, I sometimes observe him at night. It seems that he uses that time to hunt evil spirits. Helping us by day and helping others at night… how admirable! I just hope he doesn’t overwork himself.</p>

    <p class="narrationBlack">It’s been half a year since Sam has been living with us and he’s gotten a lot more comfortable at interaction.</p>

    <p class="narrationBlack">I too, have gotten more comfortable interacting with him. It’s so nice to have someone to talk to about different subjects with. I’ve never really been able to connect with others, so this feeling is refreshing. I wonder why I feel so at ease around him? Maybe it’s because we’re outcasts, unable to truly fit anywhere?</p>

    <p class="narrationBlack">Well, whatever the reason, I'm glad-</p>
