  <p class="aboutDescription">
    Hello! I’m your typical, run-of-the-mill Computation Arts student from Montreal. Most of my work is done in front of a computer, in the comfort of my home. I am interested in game creation, as well as urban scenery. I also enjoy the process of
    editing photos and videos in order to create fun or strange narratives. I am inspired by PC games from the 90s, the <i>Vaporwave</i> aesthetic, dark fantasy stories and classical paintings, to name a few. My work often deals with the struggle of
    living, the need for affection and the impact loneliness can have on an individual. Despite these rough themes, my compositions are usually lighthearted in nature. I create my work by using various editing software. <i>Adobe Photoshop</i> is used
    for image creation and photo modification. Video creation and editing is done with both <i>Adobe After Effects</i> and <i>Premiere Pro</i>. I’ve also made games using software such as <i>bitsy</i>, <i>Unity</i> and <i>Atom</i>. My work process is
    simple: I first make a rough outline of an idea and then get feedback from peers and teachers, if possible. Next, I begin creating the imagery I need using the aforementioned editing software. After all the necessary imagery is done, I combine
    them into a narrative and submit my work. I produce art in order to discover myself, change and grow as a person and acquire the motivation to create passion projects that I can be proud of.

  <p class="aboutDescription">
    Hey there! I’m your typical, run-of-the-mill Computation Arts student from Montreal. I am interested in game creation, as well as the process of editing photos and videos in order to create fun or strange narratives. I am inspired by PC games
    from the 90s, the <i>Vaporwave</i> aesthetic, dark fantasy stories and classical paintings, to name a few. My ideas usually come from daydreaming or certain aspects from the aforementioned inspirations. When creating a narrative, I think about
    the overall story in my head and jot down the various scenes I’ve thought up. Then, I remove anything that I deem unnecessary in order to meet the deadline. Most of my work is done in front of a computer, in the comfort of my home. Because of my
    reclusive workspace, the majority of my work takes place in houses or spaces near urban environments. These stories often feature contemplative protagonists. An example of this type of narrative is <a
      href="https://patrickchavez.github.io/cart211/root_cart211final/"><i>Letters</i></a>, which deals with the struggle of living, the need for affection and the impact loneliness can have on an individual. Conversely, I have also made lighthearted
    works, such as <a href="https://patrickchavez.github.io/cart263/Exercises/project3/"><i>From Me to You</i></a>, which is a character-driven story about a man trying to turn his mermaid friend into a human; it’s a wholesome story about the
    supportive relationship of two longtime friends. Overall, I produce art in order to discover myself, change and grow as a person and acquire the motivation to create passion projects that I can be proud of.
