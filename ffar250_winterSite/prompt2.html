      <i>Urbex Playground</i> is a site that documents abandoned infrastructures. These structures range from houses, to churches, to even factories. Most of these establishments are from Canada, but there are occasionally some structures from places like Belgium and Spain, to name a few. A typical article shows various photographs of an abandoned structure, accompanied by a brief description of the location. Occasionally, there will be personal anecdotes tied to said locations as well. The site is an archive of establishments that are soon to be forgotten by time. The photos, anecdotes and descriptions of these places might be the only way to preserve them for contemporary viewers.
